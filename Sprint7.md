# Sprint 7

I spent most of the end of Sprint 6 (and all weekend) constructing a new kind of joint---a "turret" joint, which I will
document as soon as testing allows.



## Notes on Firgelli Linear Actuator

I also purchased 2 Firgelli mini linear actuators.  The are expensive -- $80, but my initial results suggest that they are excellent.  They are very strong.  The model I have is the L16-140-35-12-P. It really does seem to produce 50 Newtons of peak force at 12 Volts drawing half an amp.  It has a built in potentiometer that gives you an absolute position.  I actually don't trust the potentiometer system---I suspect it is mechanically unreliable compared to the light-based sensor.

Nonetheless this is a real challenge to the create of the Gluss Pusher as a separate tubular linear motion.  Although my approach may be cheaper, and have a faster throw, it is hared to imagine producing 50 Netwons of force with my existing system.

Obviously, the Gluss idea could use either system.  However, I now think I will try to mount my joints to the Firgelli actuators to test those joints.  This should at least make for a nice demo, and give us a way to make a scalable system.  I'm hesistant to believe that at a $70 price point this will really be acceptable for a 20 or 50 glussion gluss, but I'm willing to try it.

## Goal for this sprint: Document the Turret Joint

The goal for this sprint is to document the Turret joint, possibly using the Firgelli acuators as an example.  I am writing 
this on Tuesday, and am attempting to 3D print some of the last pieces I need to form a tetrahedron as I write.

I will now attempt to design a mounting system to use the Firgelli actuators.
