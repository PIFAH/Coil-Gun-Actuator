# Linear-Actuator

Attempt to create simple, cheap linear actuator for giant robots and other tasks

This Repo is to hold research related to the invention of a new kind of linear actuator.

I have a prototype that does some simple stuff---I can move magnets around in various linear stable positions.
I would not say it works very well yet.  I will try to publish photos and other work more fully tomorrow.

My mind is currently in a maelstrom with several half-baked ideas.

One idea is the possibility of building multipolar magnetic devices (by which I mean they rest in several distinct 
stable states) which never "pinch" -- that is, never have magnets attract each other to the point of contact.  Another 
way of saying that is to develop mechanism that are like unto magnetic bearings---they operate on proximity but 
not contact, in order to provide robustness, low cost, and low maintenance.

This seems particularly relevant:

I don't understand why there isn't a good online simulator---perhaps I should write one.  This looks like it might work:

But does not seem to be oriented toward permanent magnets.
