# Goal: A working controllable acutator

My general hypothesis is that with a non-polarized core I should be able to make an Arduino controllable actuator.
It is not entirely obvious that I can do this without some control circuitry to determin position, but presumably if
I substitute human control for this, I can make it work.

For example, at the end of this sprint I would like a system consisting of:
* An Actuator,
* An External Power source,
* An Arduino, and
* a couple of buttons,
which allows the actuator to move in two directions based on pushing the buttons.
