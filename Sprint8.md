# Sprint 8 - Saturday October 3rd

Very thrilled with with publication of the [Turret Joint](https://github.com/PIFAH/turret-joint). Initial test are 
promising, although far more testing is needed.

We now have an actual robot, the "GlussBot #1"!

## Basic Goals for this Sprint

* Publish photos of the GlussBot #1
* Clean up existing Arduino code and publish both the way to hook up the motor controller and the code
* Write a true Cartesian space controller
* Produce a test routine that moves GlussBot #1 through its full range of motion.
* Publish video of moving GlussBot #1 and explain what it is doing
* Prepare for the October 17th open house at TechShop --- try to get a fun demo for kids! Possibly show marking or 
etching inside a bowl or other structure.
