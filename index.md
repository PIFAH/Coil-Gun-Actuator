# Gluss Pusher

## Mission

Enable makers to build new kinds of machines and robots form cheap easy-to-control modular linear motors, or pushers.

## The Story

Ever sense the mid '80s when I learned of the [octet truss](https://www.google.com/patents/US2986241?dq=octet+truss+Buckminster+Fuller&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIpI3Py6fZxgIVVxmSCh2c9QzE) while reading about Buckminster Fuller I have dreamed about replacing each strut in the octet truss with a component that could change its length.

This would be a truss that could slowly ooze like a slug--"a gluss".  Rather than attempt to biomimic bipedal humanoids, we should mimic the simplest of life forms: molluscs, worms, and amoebae. The notion of a building a robot that uses wheels should be right out.

Many others have proposed building robots out of many interchangable components, even [tensegrity based robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR0AlIwEgSE), another Bucky-inspired approach. However, these systems been addressed by Universities and Research labs. I believe the time has come to apply the tremdendous energy and creativity of Maker movement to the construction of glusses.

For this to be practical, we need to be able to obtian a single strust component, which I will call a gluss pusher, for about $20 each, so that 10 or 100 can be obtained for $200 or $2000. We also need to be able to control them widely available micro controllers and power them with cheap, safe levels of power.

A cheap gluss pusher offers many design challenges and each challeng overcome will offer new benefits to humanity in some way.  To paraphrase Freeman Dyson, the problem is infinite in all directions. We can try to make them big, small, precise, strong, sensitive, and rugged. We need a gluss big engouh to span a river, and small enough to slither up a vein to a blood clot or tumor.


## An Initial Design - Gluss Pusher v0.1

To initiate the project, I am publishing a design for a tubular permanent magnet motor that comes close to this. I think of this as the 0.1 version of a certain approach to building a cheap gluss pusher.

Put a lot of good stuff here.



## Getting Involved

As you can see, the initial design is primitive. You are probably thinking of myriad improvements and possibilities. We need thinkers, artitists, writers, tinkes, electrical engineers, programmerns and other makers that I can't imagine.

The Gluss Pusher project is part of [Public Invention for All Humanity (PIFAH)](https://github.com/PIFAH/PIFAH), and is therefore dedicated to publishing everything as free and open source--both hardware designs and software. PIFAH is dedicated to the benefit of all humanity.
