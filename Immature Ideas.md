# Idea: Use a Ferrofluid to create a simple actuator

I recenctly purchased and played around a bit with a ferrofluid. Because it is attracted to a magnetism, it seems
likely that if we put ferrofluid in a cylindrical bladder, we could apply a field to draw the fluid into a lump
(perhaps in the middle) thereby shortenining the cylinder.

# Idea: Can we use a simple air-gap filling apporach

I now wonder if we could modify the geometry of a solenoid to make a "long-throw" solenoid.  I believe the
basic prinicple that iron will be pulled in to fill an magnetized air gap could be used.

In this approach, we produce relative long magnets and use a relatively long iron core.  I don't know 
how much force is exerted in this "long model", but if enough is exerted, this could be a very elegant solution.
I think I can test this very quickly with the equipment that I have, though it will be hard to 
quantify---I need to get scientific and skilled at quanitfying these forces.
