# Status

Progress was interrupted by my trip to Maker Faire Rome on behalf of Engineers Without Borders.

Nonetheless, great progess has been made.  I now have a complete octahedron-tetrahedron cell made out of
carbon fiber tubes (with my three actuators.) Mechanically we now have but to purchase and actuators and replace the
rods with the actuators.  The Turret Joint has been further refined, developed, and tested, though more work needs to 
be done.

However, we can now shift our focus to the construction of a proper enclosure for the electronics and batteries
so that we truly have independent and repeatable cells.  We now have three physical cells, and one with electronics.

Most importantly, Marcus Lopez is interested in helping, particularly around the construction of the enclosure. This is
really the first person who has seriously offered to help.  This is far more important than any electromechanical 
progress, because the purpose of Public Invention is to form a team of inventors helping all humanity.

# Stories

* Repair the immediate breakage I made last night during destructive testing
* Test and publish photos and videos of the existing system
* Choose and purchase a battery
* Give Marcus everything needed for enclosure design (including sample materials)
* Review the mathematics of my post-width calculation---I think I have that wrong. Testing should reveal it.
* Select hardware for and experiment with radio control.
* Publish the idea of the cuboctahedronal walker.
* Purchase a large complement of acuators.

# Major Goals

* Build and demonstrate a quadrupedal walker made out of gluss by the first day of 2016.
* Demonstrate a smart-phone based control system.
* Design a low-cost robot that anyone can build at home to creatively apply gluss technology to new problems.

# Motivation

Let's review why we are doing this.

Current robots are not versatile. They neither mimic nature well nor enable creativity.

Gluss will enable people to do things they can only do with very specialized machines today. Such as span a river, climb high into a tree, prop up a dangeours building, move heavy objects in awkward situations, lift structural elements into place, dig people out from collapsed buildings, pretend to be Doc Oc, build huge temporary structures, build walking tents, build moving shelters, build expandable shelters, lift shipwrecks, and explore caves.

But you can probably think of more than that---my imagination is a bit limited.
