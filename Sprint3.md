# Sprint 3

## Status

I have not been maintaining my process discipline very well.  A lot has happened since my Sprint 2.

* I did construct a controllable Gluss Pusher.  You can see it in the video that I posted.
* At considerable effort, I made a 10-minute introductory [video](https://youtu.be/cpzPVwBoE_4) to the project.
* I have created an attractive 3D-printed stator. After much trial and error I am very happy with this. The new stator
and the new carbon-fiber pushrod work very effectively.  I will post a video of this very soon.

## Goals

* Document my 3D-printable design to the level of easy reproducibility
* Move closer to being able to create a 2D Planer Robot with two Gluss Pushers

## Stories

* Publish Fusion 360 designs
* Publish STL file at Thing-i-verse
* Measure voltages produced by motion against coil in order to see if we can build closed-loop detection of our position.
* Switch to using the motor controller to see if we can get micro-step control.
* Cut Acrylic tube in order to have actuator stability.
* Consider a "shaking" of one coil to see if we can detect other coils.
* Consider possibility of building coil rings into the stator further down in order to provide true positional control.
* Compare possiblity of using coil ring with Hall Effect sensors.
