Sprint 5 saw the successful completions of the [CoilChoice tool](http://pifah.github.io/CoilChoice/).
It was a strenuous effort and I am quite proud of it, though as far as I can tell nobody has noticed it yet.

# Theme

I believe the main theme of this sprint is to return to more 3D design.

I have what I believe is an idea for limited ball-and-socket joints for the Octet joints that is worthy of the title
"invention".  It is worth about 1 micro-Fuller, I think.  

In addition to that, I need to redesign the stator, and produce a stator-tube end cap to hold the position sensing electronis.
Basically we are now moving toward a completely scalable and independent "Glussion".

### Measurement of force of existing system.

At 12 volts, turning scale sideways, the highest force I can measure in a holding pattern 98 grams. 
At 18 volts, it is 160 grams. At 24V, 235 grams. At 30 Volts it began smoking very quickly! This heat definitely softened, perhaps destructively, the PLA plastic.

I expected this to be low, but this is really bad---I estimate we need about 10 times this much force to have a viable system.

I believe I am using 32 gauge wire right now. CoilChoice suggests that I should use 30 gauge wire.  However, it still seems somewhat unlike that we can get up to a 22 newton (1 kilogram of force system) with a 2-amp limitation.  It seems absolutely essential that we go up to 5 amps.

Our current coils provably have about 250 ampere turns at 12 volts. A 5 amp system using 28 gauge wire should provide about 750 ampere turns -- about 3 newtons, which still sucks.  

It seems possible that I should perhaps abandon this approach, or at least get the Phidget's actuators for comparison.

Quite possibly this whole project is bogus because of the difficulty of producing force in this way.

I think is pretty important now that I test the lithium io battery approach.
