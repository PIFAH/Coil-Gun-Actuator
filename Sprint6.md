Sprint 5 saw the successful completions of the [CoilChoice tool](http://pifah.github.io/CoilChoice/).
It was a strenuous effort and I am quite proud of it, though as far as I can tell nobody has noticed it yet.

# Theme

I believe the main theme of this sprint is to return to more 3D design.

I have what I believe is an idea for limited ball-and-socket joints for the Octet joints that is worthy of the title
"invention".  It is worth about 1 micro-Fuller, I think.  

In addition to that, I need to redesign the stator, and produce a stator-tube end cap to hold the position sensing electronis.
Basically we are now moving toward a completely scalable and independent "Glussion".
